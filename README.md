## Note about lesson life cycle stage
Although the `config.yaml` states the life cycle stage as pre-alpha, **the template is stable and ready to use**. The life cycle stage is preset to `"pre-alpha"` as this setting is appropriate for new lessons initialised using the template.

      the contents of the template Contributing Guide may not be appropriate.
      You should adjust the file to help guide contributors on how best
      to get involved and make an impact on your lesson.
