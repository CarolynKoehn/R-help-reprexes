-   Identify the necessary or relevant aspects of the data to replicate your issue
-   Share your own dataset in a way that is minimal, accessible, and reproducible
-   Create a dataset from scratch to reproduce a given example
-   Subset an existing dataset to reproduce a given example

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 3.1 What is a minimal reproducible dataset and why do I need it?

Now that you have narrowed down your problem area and stripped down your code to make it minimal we need to ensure it is reproducible; this means it needs to be accessible and runnable such that anyone else can copy-paste it into their system, run the code, and replicate your issue. Importantly, an **example code will always require example data** in order to run! Therefore, **every reprex requires you to provide a minimal reproducible dataset to use with the code**. 

::: instructor
Development note: Sections above should talk about making the code minimal and introduce the need for it to be reproducible. This data episode is part of being reproducible and should perhaps be followed-up with more details on reproducibility (e.g., reprex needs minimal code - check - dependencies, which include minimal data - check - and other basic information like your system and R version as well as contextual information on your data?).
:::

Furthermore, as we have seen previously, sometimes the source of the problem isn't actually your code, but rather your data! By providing an example dataset that, when used in your example code, still replicates your issue, you also **give your helper the opportunity to better investigate and manipulate that data** to fix your issue. It would be great if we could give the helper our entire computer so they could just take over where we left off, but usually we can't.

Just as we did with our code, when providing such an example dataset we also want to make sure we keep it minimal--free of unnecessary data. This will allow your helper to more clearly see what the data looks like and what the source of your issue may be. Furthermore, it will allow you to not only better understand your data but also potentially work out the source of your issue. When extraneous information is removed and only the parts that replicate the issue are kept, we can begin to see where the issues arise. 

In short, a minimal reproducible dataset must be:

-   **minimal**: it only contains the necessary information to run your minimal code. You can also think of this as being **relevant** to the problem: keep only what is necessary. 
-   **reproducible**: it must be **accessible** to someone without your computer, and it must consistently replicate your output/issue. This means it also needs to be **complete**,  meaning there are no dependencies that have been omitted.

::: callout
### Remember: your helper may not be in the room with you or have access to your computer and the files that are on it! 

You might be used to always uploading data from separate files, but helpers can't access those files. Even if you sent someone a file, they would need to put it in the right directory, make sure to load it in exactly the same way, make sure their computer can open it, etc. Since the goal is to make everyone's lives as easy as possible, we need to think about our data in a different way--as a dummy object created in the script itself.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::: callout
### Pro-tip
An example of what minimal reproducible examples look like can also be found in the `?help` section, in R Studio. Just scroll all the way down to where there are examples listed.
These will usually be minimal and reproducible.

For example, let's look at the function `mean`:

```{r}
?mean
```

We see examples that can be run directly on the console, with no additional code.

```{r}
x <- c(0:10, 50)
xm <- mean(x)
c(xm, mean(x, trim = 0.10))
```

In this case, x is the dummy dataset consisting of just 1 variable. Notice how it was created as part of the example.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::: challenge
### Exercise 1

These datasets are not well suited for use in a reprex.
For each one, try to reproduce the dataset on your own in R (copy-paste).
Does it work?
What happened?
Explain.

A) ![](fig/data_screenshot.png){alt='Screenshot of the ratdat comple_old dataset.'}
B)  `sample_data <- read_csv(“/Users/kaija/Desktop/RProjects/ResearchProject/data/sample_dataset.csv”)`
C)  `dput(complete_old[1:100,])`
D)  `sample_data <- data.frame(species = species_vector, weight = c(10, 25, 14, 26, 30, 17))`

::: solution
### Solution

A)  Not reproducible because it is a screenshot.
B)  Not reproducible because it is a path to a file that only exists on someone else’s computer and therefore you do not have access to it using that path.
C)  Not minimal, it has far too many columns and probably too many rows. It is also not reproducible because we were not given the source for `complete_old`.
D)  Not reproducible because we are not given the source for `species_vector`.

:::: challenge

### Exercise 2

Let's say we want to know the average weight of all the species in our `rodents` dataset. We try to use the following code...

```{r}
mean(rodents$weight)
```

...but it returns NA! We don't know why that is happening and we want to ask for help. 

Which of the following represents a minimal reproducible dataset for this code?
Can you describe why the other ones are not?

A)  `sample_data <- data.frame(month = rep(7:9, each = 2), hindfoot_length = c(10, 25, 14, 26, 30, 17))`
B)  `sample_data <- data.frame(weight = rnorm(10))`
C)  `sample_data <- data.frame(weight = c(100, NA, 30, 60, 40, NA))`
D)  `sample_data <- sample(rodents$weight, 10)`
E)  `sample_data <- rodents_modified[1:20,]`

::: solution

### Solution

The correct answer is C!

A)  does not include the variable of interest (weight).
B)  does not produce the same problem (NA result with a warning message)--the code runs just fine.
C)  minimal and reproducible.
D)  is not reproducible. Sample randomly samples 10 items; sometimes it may include NAs, sometime it may not (not guaranteed to reproduce the error). It can be used if a seed is set (see next section for more info).
E)  uses a dataset that isn't accessible without previous data wrangling code–the object rodents_modified doesn't exist.

## 3.2 Can I just use my own data?

At this point you may still be wondering why you need a separate dataset, can't you just use your own data if you made sure your helper could access it?

::: instructor
Here you can ask the class if they can think of any reasons why using your own data may not be possible or, altough possible, not a good idea.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::: callout
There are several reasons why you might need to create a separate dataset that is minimal and reproducible instead of trying to use your actual dataset.
The original dataset may be:

-   too large - the Portal dataset is \~35,000 rows with 13 columns and contains data for decades. That's a lot!
-   private - your dataset might not be published yet, or maybe you're studying an endangered species whose locations can't easily be shared. Another example: many medical datasets cannot be shared publically.
-   hard to send - on most online forums, you can't attach supplemental files (more on this later). Even if you are just sending data to a colleague, file paths can get complicated, the data might be too large to attach, etc.
-   complicated - it would be hard to locate the relevant information. One example to steer away from are needing a 'data dictionary' to understand all the meanings of the columns (e.g. what is "plot type" in `ratdat`?) We don't our helper to waste valuable time to figure out what everything means.
-   highly derived/modified from the original file. You may have already done a bunch of preliminary data wrangling you don't want to include when you send the example, so you would need to provide the intermediate dataset directly to your helper.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If so, you wouldn't be entirely wrong. While there could be several ways in which your original data may be inaccessible or hard to derive or subset, there are likely just as many ways you could make it minimal and reproducible. Nevertheless, this does not mean making your own original data minimal and reproducible will necessarily be easier than creating a new dataset from scratch. If the mere thought of any of this sounds daunting, don't worry, we will break it down into smaller steps.  

## 3.3 How do I create a minimal reproducible dataset?

In general, there are 3 common ways to provide minimal reproducible data for a reprex. 

- You can write a script that creates a new "dummy" dataset with the same key characteristics as your original data.

- You can use a dataset that is already embedded in R and is therefore already accessible.

- You can make your own data minimal and reproducible.

For the purpose of this lesson, we believe each coder is entitled to all the options, therefore we will walk you through how to provide a minimal reproducible dataset using each of these 3 methods. However, opinions generally differ on which method is best for which situations. Below we compiles a summary table of advantages and disadvantages of each method based on many conversations with several groups.

[ INSERT TABLE]

### 3.3.1 Creating a "dummy" dataset from scratch

While this might be the most daunting option for novices, it tends to be the preferred methods for experts. That's probably because, once you really understand the basic building blocks, it becomes the most straight-forward method of creating a minimal reproducible dataset. This is also the method that makes most sense when doing other activities that also require a reprex (e.g., teaching, collaborating, developing). Lastly, in this lesson we believe there are greater problem-solving insights to be gained by creating a new "dummy" dataset. So let's start by making this scary process more easily digestible!

Usually, at this stage, you would have 2 pressing quesions:

1. How do I create a dataset?
2. How do I recreate the key elements of my data that replicate my issue?

Let's start with the first.

There are many ways one can create a dataset in R.

You can start by creating vectors using `c()`

```{r}
vector <- c(1,2,3,4) 
vector
```

You can also add some randomness by sampling from a vector using `sample()`.

For example you can sample numbers 1 through 10 in a random order

```{r}
x <- sample(1:10)
x
```

Or you can randomly sample from a normal distribution

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
x
```

You can also use `letters` to create factors.

```{r}
x <- sample(letters[1:4], 20, replace=T)
x
```

Remember that a data frame is just a collection of vectors. You can create a data frame using `data.frame` (or `tibble` in the `dplyr` package). You can then create a vector for each variable. 

```{r}
data <- data.frame (x = sample(letters[1:3], 20, replace=T), 
                    y = rnorm(1:20))
head(data)
```

**However**, when sampling at random you must remember to `set.seed()` before sending it to someone to make sure you both get the same numbers!

::: callout
For more handy functions for creating data frames and variables, see the cheatsheet.
For some questions, specific formats can be needed.
For these, one can use any of the provided as.someType functions: `as.factor`, `as.integer`, `as.numeric`, `as.character`, `as.Date`, `as.xts`.

::: instructor
You can skip the challenge below or you can run through it together to illustrate the above.

:::: challenge
### Now Practice! (Optional)
Create a data frame with:

A. One categorical variable with 2 levels and one continuous variable.
B. One continuous variable that is normally distributed. 
C. Name, sex, age, and treatment type.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### 3.3.2 Identifying the key elements of your data

No matter which approach we take for providing a dataset, we need to identify which elements of our original data are necessary. To do so, we propose starting a few simple questions to investigate your data:

- How many variables do we need?
- What data type (discrete or continuous) is each variable?
- How many levels and/or observations are necessary?
- Should the values be distributed in a specific way?
- Are there any NAs that could be relevant?

Let's come back to our kangaroo rats example. Here is the minimal code we settled on:

```{r}
# Minimal code[Or whatever we end up with]
krats_subset <- rodents %>%
  filter(species == c("ordii", "spectabilis"),
         sex == c("F", "M"))

table(krats_subset$sex, krats_subset$species)
```

So we want to create a minimal reproducible 'dummy' version of `krats_subet`. Let's start by taking a quick look, then aswering the questions.

```{r}
head(krats_subset)
```

:::: challenge
### Excercise 3 
Try to answer the following questions on your own to determine what we need to include in our minimal reproducible dataset:

1. How many variables do we need? 
1. What data type (discrete or continuous) is each variable?
1. How many levels and/or observations are necessary?
1. Should the values be distributed in a specific way?
1. Are there any NAs that could be relevant?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::: instructor
After giving them some time to think it through on their own, work together through the answers
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's go over the answers together and build a dataset as we go along!

1. How many variables do we need? 

We need species, sex, and maybe a third identifier like record_id. This means we potentially need 3 vector (remember, each column in a dataframe is essentially just a vector).

1. What data type (discrete or continuous) is each variable?

Species and sex are both discrete (categorical) variables, while record ID would be more continuous.

1. How many levels and/or observations are necessary?

Since we are filtering our dataset down to 2 categories for both species and sex, that means we need at least 3 levels in each to start with. In terms of number of observations there don't seem to be specific restrictions other than we probably want at least 1 observations per original category, so 2*3=6, or we can just pick another typical nice number like 10.

1. Should the values be distributed in a specific way?

Since question probably isn't going to be relevant most of the time, but certainly worth considering. If we needed a longer dataset of measurements we may have wanted to make sure it was normally distributed. If we needed a longer dataset of counts we may have wanted to make sure it was Poisson distributed. Or maybe we had bimodal data. But in this case, we had a short dataset and I don't think it matters. We can always come back to this if we are unable to replicate our issue (hint: in which case the distribution may be related to the issue).

1. Are there any NAs that could be relevant?

We don't have any NAs but we do have a blank category under sex. For all we know that could be important, so maybe we want to also make one of our categories blank.

```{r}
# We need 3 variables: species, sex, and record_id
# species and sex are categorical with at least 3 levels, one of which is blank for sex
species <- sample(letters, 3, replace=F)
print(species)
sex <- c('M','F','')
print(sex)

# record_id is continuous 
record_id <- 1:10
print(record_id)

# Now let's go sampling and put it all together
sample <- data.frame(
  record_id = record_id,
  species = sample(species, 10, replace=T),
  sex = sample(sex, 10, replace=T)
)
print(sample)
```

And just like that we created a 'dummy' dataset from scratch! Notice that we could also have compiled the same type of dataset in a single line by creating each vector already within the `data.frame()`

```{r}
sample2 <- data.frame(
  record_id = 1:10,
  species = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace=T),
  sex = sample(c('M','F',''), 10, replace=T)
)
print(sample2)
```

**Note**: if you want the outputs to be EXACTLY the same each time, but you are using `sample()` which is an inherently random process, you must first use `set.seed()` and share that with your helper too.

```{r}
set.seed(1) # set seed before recreating the sample
sample <- data.frame(
  record_id = 1:10,
  species = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace=T),
  sex = sample(c('M','F',''), 10, replace=T)
)
print(sample)
```

Great! Now we need to check whether it works within our code and whether it reproduces our issue

```{r}
# Minimal code [or whatever we end up with] 
sample_subset <- sample %>% # replace rodents with our sample dataset
  filter(species == c("a", "b"), # replace species with those from our sample dataset
         sex == c("F", "M")) # this can stay the same because we recreated it the same

table(sample_subset$sex, sample_subset$species)
```
Oh, oh! It seems that in the process of recreating our issue we have stumbled upon another one!

Is the problem in our "new" code with replaced variables or in the sample dataset we created? To find out let's try using the other sample dataset we created before we used `set.seed()`

```{r}
sample2_subset <- sample2 %>% # replace rodents with our sample dataset
  filter(species == c("a", "b"), # replace species with those from our sample dataset
         sex == c("F", "M")) # this can stay the same because we recreated it the same

table(sample2_subset$sex, sample2_subset$species)
```

Ok! We do get our same issue this time (maybe, maybe you didn't given that the seed isn't the same)



#### OLD PARTS #####

Great!
Now we have a sample data set that is minimal, but is is reproducible?

::: instructor
Give them time to think about it and answer the question.
:::

It isn't!
Why?

Remember: sample() creates a random dataset!
This will not be consistently reproducible.
In order to make this example fully reproducible we should first `set.seed()`.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
sample_data <- data.frame(
  Species = sample(species, 20, replace=T),
  Plot = sample(plot.type, 20, replace=T),
  Day = days
)
head(sample_data)
```

Now we have our minimal reproducible example!
But are we sure it reproduces what we are trying to reproduce?
Let's test it out.

```{r}
sample_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Day, fill = Plot)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.6)+
  facet_wrap(~Species)+ 
  theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma")
```

Yes!

It is certainly simplified, but it has the elements we want it to have.
And now we can ask how to get rid of "C".

Given that this was a very simple question, we could have simplified this example even further; we could have used 2 species and even just 2 days, in which case a simple solution could be

```{r}
sample_data2 <- data.frame(
species = sample(c('A','B'), 6, replace = T),
days = 1:2
)

sample_data2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=days)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
which is even more simplistic than the one before but still contains the elements we are interested in--we have a set of "species" separated into facets and we want to get rid of one of them. In reality, had we realized that we needed to get rid of the rows with "sp." in them, we could have ignored the figure entirely and posed the question about the data alone. E.g., "how do I remove rows that contain a specific name?" Then give just the example dataset we created.



### 4.3.2 Create a dataset using an existing dataset

If you don't want to create a dataset from scratch, maybe because you have too many variables or it's a more complicated structure and you are not sure where the error is, you can subset from an existing dataset. Useful functions for subsetting a dataset include `subset()`, `head()`, `tail()`, and indexing with [] (e.g., iris[1:4,]). Alternatively, you can use tidyverse functions like `select()`, and `filter()` from the tidyverse. You can also use the same `sample()` functions we covered earlier.

A list of readily available datasets can be found using `library(help="datasets")`. You can then use `?` in front of the dataset name to get more information about the contents of the dataset.

When working with a built-in dataset you still have to edit your code to fit the new data, but it is probably faster than building a large dataset from scratch, and it gets easier with practice! 

Let's keep using our previous example, how can we reproduce that figure using the existing dataset `mpg`. First, let's interrogate this dataset to see what we are working with.

```{r}
?mpg
```

Which variable from mpg do you think we could use to replace our variables? Remember: we need one for species, one for plot type, and one for date.

There are certainly multiple options! Let's go with model for species, manufacturer for plot type, and year for date.

```{r}
data <- mpg %>% select(model, manufacturer, year)
dim(data)
glimpse(data)
```

We only need 4 species, and 5 plots. How many do we have here?

```{r}
length(unique(data$model)) 
length(unique(data$manufacturer))
```

Certainly more than we need. Then let's simplify.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
data <- data %>%
    filter(model %in% sample(model, 4, replace = F))
```
Cool, now we have just 4 models. BUT we also only have 2 years... so maybe year wasn't the best choice afterall, let's change it to hwy

```{r}
data <- mpg %>% select(model, manufacturer, hwy) %>%
  filter(model %in% sample(model, 4, replace = F))
```

Now we can try our plot

```{r}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hwy, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.6)+
  facet_wrap(~model)+ 
  theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma")
```

Do you think that works?

It turns out that maybe manufacturer was not the best representation for plot, since we do need each car model to appear in each "plot". What would all cars have?

Let's change model to manufacturer, and let's add class.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
data2 <- mpg %>% select(manufacturer, class, hwy) %>%
  filter(manufacturer %in% sample(manufacturer, 4, replace = F))
  
data2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hwy, fill = class)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.6)+
  facet_wrap(~manufacturer)+ 
  theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma")
```
That's more like it! You can keep playing around with it or you can give it more thought apriori, but either way you get the idea. While what we get is not an exact replica, it's an analogy. The important thing is that we created a figure whose basic elements/structure or "key features" remain intact--namely, the number and type of variables and categories.

Now it is your turn!

:::: challenge

### Excercise 4

For each of the following, identify which data are necessary to create a minimal reproducible dataset using `mpg`.

A) We want to know how the highway mpg has changed over the years  
B) We need a list of all "types" of cars and their fuel type for each manufacturer  
C) We want to compare the average city mpg for a compact car from each manufacturer  
:::

**OR change the above challenge to be about ratdat**

**OR move to...**

Now that we know how many of each species were captured over the years, we want to know how many of each species you might expect to catch per day. 

Let's practice how we would do this with our data.

::: instructor
Let the students try it out and discuss outloud
:::

We end up with the following code:

```{r}
krats_per_day <- krats %>%
  group_by(date, year, species) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  group_by(species)

krats_per_day %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = n))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)+
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.2)+
  theme_classic()+
  ylab("Number per day")+
  xlab("Species")
```

:::: challenge

### Excercise 5

How might you reproduce this using the mpg dataset?

::: solution

  Substitute krats with cars, species with class, date with year. The question becomes, how many cars of each class are produced per year?
  
```{r}
  set.seed(1)
    cars_per_y <- mpg %>%
    filter(class %in% sample(class, 4, replace=F)) %>%
    group_by(class, year) %>%
    summarize(n=n()) %>%
    group_by(class)
    
  cars_per_y %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = class, y = n))+
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)+
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha=0.2)+
    theme_classic()+
    ylab("Cars per year")+
    xlab("Class")
  
  # this is only giving us 3 classes even though we asked for 4, why?
  
  # Because it is sampling from the column "class" which has many of the same class. 
  # Therefore, we need to specify that we want to sample from within the unique values in "class".
  
  cars_per_y <- mpg %>%
    filter(class %in% sample(unique(mpg$class), 4, replace=F)) %>%
    group_by(class, year) %>%
    summarize(n=n()) %>%
    group_by(class)
    
  cars_per_y %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = class, y = n))+
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)+
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha=0.2)+
    theme_classic()+
    ylab("Cars per year")+
    xlab("Class")

## 4.4 Using your own data by creating a minimal subset

Perhaps you are now thinking that if you can use a subset of an existing dataset, wouldn't it be easier to just subset my own data to make it minimal? You are not wrong. There are cases when you can subset your own data in the same way you would subset an existing dataset to make a minimal dataset, the key is to then make it reproducible. That's when we use the function `dput`, which essentially takes your dataframe and give you code to reproduce it!

For example, using our previous data2

```{r}
dput(cars_per_y)
```

As you can see, even with our minimal dataset, it is still quite a chunk of code. What if you tried putting in krats_per_day? It is clear that either way you will still need to considerably minimize your data. Even then, it will often be simpler to provide an existing dataset or provide one from scratch. Furthermore, often we are able to discover the source of our error or solve our own problem when we have to go through the process of breaking it down into its essential components!

Nevertheless, it remains an option for when your data appears too complex or you are not quite sure where your error lies and therefore are not sure what minimal components are needed to reproduce the example.

::: callout
*What about NAs?* If your data has NAs and they may be causing the problem, it is important to include them in your MR dataset. You can find where there are NAs in your dataset by using `is.na`, for example: `is.na(krats$weight)`. This will return a logical vector or TRUE if the cell contains an NA and FALSE if not. 
The simplest way to include NAs in your dummy dataset is to directly include it in vectors: `x <- c(1,2,3,NA)`. You can also subset a dataset that already contains NAs, or change some of the values to NAs using `mutate(ifelse())` or substitute all the values in a column by sampling from within a vector that contains NAs. 

One important thing to note when subsetting a dataset with NAs is that subsetting methods that use a condition to match rows won’t necessarily match NA values in the way you expect. For example
```{r}
test <- data.frame(x = c(NA, NA, 3, 1), y = rnorm(4))
test %>% filter(x != 3) 
# you might expect that the NA values would be included, since “NA is not equal to 3”. But actually, the expression NA != 3 evaluates to NA, not TRUE. So the NA rows will be dropped!
# Instead you should use is.na() to match NAs
test %>% filter(x != 3 | is.na(x))
```

Here are some more practice exercises if you wish to test your knowledge

**(I copied these from excercise 6 in the google doc... but I'm not sure that they are getting at the point of the lesson...)**

:::: challenge
### Excercise 6 

Each of the following examples needs your help to create a dataset that will correctly reproduce the given result and/or warning message when the code is run. Fix the dataset shown or fill in the blanks so it reproduces the problem.

A) `set.seed(1)`
   `sample_data <- data.frame(fruit = rep(c(“apple”, “banana”), 6), weight = rnorm(12))`
   `ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = fruit, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()`
   **HELP: how do I insert an image from clipboard?? Is it even possible?**
B) bodyweight <- c(12, 13, 14, __, __)
   max(bodyweight)
   [1] NA
C) sample_data <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 4:6)
   mean(sample_data$x)
   [1] NA
   Warning message:
   In mean.default(sample_data$x): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA
D) sample_data <- ____
   dim(sample_data)
   NULL 

::: solution

  A) "fruit" needs to be a factor and the order of the levels must be specified:
     `sample_data <- data.frame(fruit = factor(rep(c("apple", "banana"), 6), levels = c("banana",          "apple")), weight = rnorm(12))`
  B) one of the blanks must be an NA
  C) **?? + what's really the point of this one?**
  D) `sample_data <- data.frame(x = factor(1:3), y = 4:6)`

::: keypoints
-   A minimal reproducible dataset contains (a) the minimum number of lines, variables, and categories, in the correct format, to reproduce a certain problem; and (b) it must be fully reproducible, meaning that someone else can reproduce the same problem using only the information provided.
-   You can create a dataset from scratch using `as.data.frame`, you can use available datasets like `iris` or you can use a subset of your own dataset
-   You can share your own data by first subsetting it into its minimal components and then using `dput()` to create it via reproducible code
